    <p><strong>Welcome to the DITA world</strong></p>
    <p class="welcome-fragment-text">The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML based information typing architecture, originally developed for creating software documentation. Today DITA has evolved due to various specializations and is now flexible enough for being used to, for example, creating books, e-learnings and presentations. DITA is made for topic-oriented and single-source authoring. This means, you create little information chunks and can re-use and re-combine them as you want. The published medium can be determined and changed at any time and is not linked to the content.</p>
    <p class="welcome-fragment-text">This website has been made to give a small overview of DITA, helps you to get started and is itself created with DITA XML. The content is released under the Apache Public License 2 (APL2) and can be found on Github.</p>
